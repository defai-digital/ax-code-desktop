# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-19

### Changed
- **Infrastructure**: migrated from Bun to Node.js + pnpm for better ecosystem compatibility and native module support. All scripts, CI workflows, and contributor documentation updated. Bun lockfile removed, pnpm workspace and lockfile added.
- **Performance**: optimized startup and shutdown paths to reduce latency. Server shutdown now uses structured lifecycle hooks with configurable timeouts.

### Fixed
- **Sync**: resolved persistent "no assistant response" errors on second+ prompts through multiple fixes:
  - Increased watchdog timeout from 12s to 60s and grace window from 30s to 60s (v1.2.9)
  - Added grace-window re-arm to prevent false errors from transient SSE idle events (v1.2.8)
  - Cancelled stale watchdog timers from previous prompts (v1.2.7)
  - Guarded async recovery against cross-turn clobbering (v1.2.7)
- **Tests**: stubbed WebSocket in event-pipeline tests for vitest/jsdom compatibility. Fixed test runner to use vitest instead of bun test.
- **Electron**: renamed app from "AX Code Desktop" to "AX Code" for consistency. Fixed electron-builder configuration to pass resolved electronVersion.
- **Docker**: kept vendored @ax-code/sdk dist in build context to prevent missing dependencies.
- **Dependencies**: overrode node-gyp to ^11 so native builds work on Python 3.12.

### Added
- **Testing**: added comprehensive vitest configuration with coverage reporting. Migrated all test files from bun test to vitest.

## [1.2.9] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- Sync: increased watchdog timeout from 12s to 60s and grace window from 30s to 60s to prevent false "no assistant response" errors on slower models or network conditions. The watchdog now waits longer before fabricating an error, giving the assistant more time to respond. This addresses persistent reports of the error appearing on second+ prompts even after previous fixes.

## [1.2.8] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- Sync: the accepted-prompt watchdog no longer fabricates a false "no assistant response" error when an SSE `session.idle` / `session.status:idle` event transiently clobbers busy→idle during the 30s prompt-accepted grace window. The grace window (`wasPromptRecentlyAccepted`) previously only guarded the status-poll/reconnect path (`resolveResyncedSessionStatus`), not the event-reducer's direct status writes. The watchdog's fabrication branch now checks `wasPromptRecentlyAccepted` and re-arms itself to fire again after the grace window expires, so transient grace-window clobbers do not produce false errors while genuinely dead turns (idle + no response after grace expires) are still caught. This fixes the "first prompt works, second prompt fails" pattern in v1.2.7.

## [1.2.7] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- Sync: stale accepted-prompt watchdog from a previous prompt no longer fires during the next prompt's turn and clobbers the busy status to idle. The watchdog timer is now cancelled when a new prompt is sent for the same session (`scheduleAcceptedPromptWatchdog` tracks and clears the previous timer via `acceptedPromptWatchdogTimers`). A defense-in-depth guard also prevents the idle-forcing branch from running when a newer user message exists without its own assistant reply. This was the root cause of the "The request was accepted, but no assistant response or error was produced" error appearing on every 2nd+ prompt in v1.2.6.
- Sync: the watchdog's async server-refetch recovery path (`recoverAcceptedPromptFromServer`) no longer clobbers a newer prompt's busy status. The `await` during recovery created a timing window where a new prompt could start; when recovery completed, it found the old prompt's completed response and forced idle based on `isSessionWorking()` alone — without checking whether a newer unanswered user message existed. Extracted `hasNewerUnansweredUserMessage` as a shared guard applied to both the initial-match and recovery branches.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-06-18

- Sync: the session watchdog (12s busy-to-idle timeout) no longer fires on 2nd+ prompts. `markPromptAccepted` now runs synchronously before the async `input.send()` call, closing the ~50-200ms race window where the periodic status poll could clobber the optimistic busy state to idle. Once clobbered, the watchdog's guard treated the existing idle status as a no-op, so it always timed out on every subsequent prompt. A regression test exercises the exact race across 4 consecutive prompts.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-06-18

- Origins (loopback): the request-security same-origin/CSRF check now treats `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `[::1]` as interchangeable loopback addresses, so accessing the app via one when it is bound to another no longer fails the origin check. Host parsing now uses `new URL()` instead of a naive `host.split(':')`, which previously broke on bracketed IPv6 hosts (e.g. `[::1]:3000`).
- Passkeys: `getCurrentRequestOrigin` now derives the WebAuthn relying-party origin via `new URL().origin` (with a safe fallback) for consistent, IPv6-safe origin derivation across registration and authentication.
- Skills catalog (SSH parsing): the server-side `parseSkillRepoSource` and the client-side catalog label guesser now handle bracketed IPv6 SSH hosts (e.g. `git@[2001:db8::1]:group/repo.git`) and nested groups (`group/subgroup/repo`), instead of mis-splitting the host or dropping path segments. The UI label logic was extracted from `AddCatalogDialog` into a testable `catalogSourceLabels` module.
- Plugins: `isExactSemver` now correctly accepts combined pre-release + build metadata (e.g. `1.2.3-beta.1+build.5`) using proper semver character classes, instead of the overly loose previous pattern.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-06-18

- Terminal: when a backpressured SSE client disconnected before its socket drained, cleanup ended the response so the one-shot `drain` listener never fired, leaving the session's shared pty paused indefinitely. Because the pty is shared across all clients of the session and also feeds the output replay buffer, this froze terminal output for every remaining client and any later reconnect. Teardown now tracks whether this client left the pty paused and resumes it, mirroring the close/error/abort-aware drain handling already used by the ax-code SSE proxy.
- Event stream: when a client reconnected with a `Last-Event-ID` whose anchor had been evicted from the replay buffer (instead of merely being behind it), the bridge failed to recover. Both the server-side event-stream bridge and the browser-side event-stream layer now replay the full buffer when the anchor is missing/evicted, restoring a complete view after a gap.
- Sync: resolved reconnect, streaming, and watchdog correctness bugs in the UI sync layer.
- Electron: handle the reveal-path and open-file-in-app IPC messages; normalize fetched app-icon payloads before rendering; detect packaged Windows Terminal installs (in addition to portable) when resolving the default terminal.
- Build/tooling: TypeScript path aliases are now baseUrl-free; the desktop smoke workflow defaults to the current repo; the release smoke step honors the no-bundle flag; the About dialog's upstream link now points at the correct repo.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-06-17

- Server (critical): the dedicated `/api/session/:id/prompt_async` and `/command` proxy handlers now forward the real request body verbatim instead of `JSON.stringify(req.body ?? {})`. The `/api/session/*` routes intentionally bypass `express.json()` so the generic streaming proxy can forward raw bodies, which left `req.body` undefined and caused the handler to send `{}` to ax-code — no model, no parts — producing an opaque `InvalidRequestError` (400) for **every** prompt. The handler now reads the raw stream and forwards it as-is, parsing locally only to recover the message/command id for dedup. This was the root cause behind the prompt-send 400s that the earlier client-side model-guard work could not fix.
- Client: `sendMessage` now guards against an empty/undefined `providerID` or `modelID` and throws a clear, actionable error before sending, protecting every caller (assistant-fork, new-worktree, GitHub-issue, multi-run-fusion) — not just the ChatInput path. On a terminal non-OK response it also logs the rejected payload shape (provider/model/agent/variant + summarized parts) for diagnosis.
- Client: the stale-model error message now detects the real backend envelope (`details.resource === 'providerModel'` / "Provider model not found") instead of a `ProviderModelNotFoundError` name the backend never emits.
- Client: `sendMessage` now drops a file part `id` unless it is a valid `prt_` part id and regenerates a non-`msg`-prefixed message id when needed, since either bad prefix makes the backend reject the whole prompt with the same opaque 400.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-06-17

- Client: `sendMessage` now parses structured backend error bodies and maps `ProviderModelNotFoundError` (returned by `prompt_async` when the provider/model pair is stale) to a clear "The selected model is no longer available" message instead of surfacing the raw 400 JSON. Fixes #40.
- Client: `sendMessage` now omits the `agent` and `variant` fields from the prompt payload when they are unset, instead of serializing them as `null`. The AX Code backend rejects `null` for these fields with `InvalidRequestError` (400). The payload now uses conditional spread matching the `sendCommand` pattern.
- Client: removed dead `readFile`/`listFiles` methods that were never called and used `POST` against `GET`-only `/api/fs/read` and `/api/fs/list` endpoints. The actual implementations in `RuntimeAPIs` (`packages/web/src/api/files.ts`) are unaffected and use the correct verbs.
- Electron: support/help links now point at the desktop repository (`defai-digital/ax-code-desktop`) rather than the upstream CLI repo.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-17

- Security: the `/api/fs/reveal` endpoint (reveal in Finder / Explorer) now resolves the requested path through the shared `resolveWorkspaceOrApprovedPathFromContext` authorization helper, rejecting paths outside the project workspace and the user's approved directories with HTTP 400. Previously it called `path.resolve()` directly, which allowed arbitrary filesystem paths to be opened in the host file explorer. This closes the last authorization gap among the filesystem endpoints, which otherwise already enforced workspace/approved-directory containment.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-17

- Release: minor version bump. No application changes since 1.1.9.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-06-17

- Provider: centralized provider fetch logic into a shared `providerApi` module with retry, parsing, and three read functions; refactored ProvidersPage and ProvidersSidebar to use it. Added SDK base URL normalization to prevent stale `/api/config` suffixes from breaking provider endpoints. Added proxy compatibility rewrite counters for diagnostic visibility.
- Desktop: prevented data loss in `moveDirectoryContents` and removed stale `useEffect` dependencies.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-06-16

- Proxy: the SSE forwarder (`/api/event`, `/api/global/event`) now signals `restarting: true` on its 503 when the AX Code upstream is unreachable, matching the established transient-unreachability contract from the generic API proxy error handler and the readiness gate. Previously it emitted a bare 503 (no `restarting`), which could dead-end EventSource clients instead of letting them reconnect/poll until ax-code recovers.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-06-16

- Tooling: ported the hardened minisign signer feature set from ax-engine_v5 into `scripts/minisign-artifacts.sh` and `scripts/minisign-keygen.sh`, while keeping the desktop-specific release key (`5B7AB63CD6D674BE`). The signing script now supports `--public-key-string` (verify with a raw key string, no `.pub` file), `--signature-dir`, `--keychain-service`/`--keychain-account` flags, `--pinned-public-key` override, and verify-with-string-or-file, with robust passphrase resolution (env > macOS Keychain > prompt), up-front path validation for accurate dry-runs, and a pinned-key fail-closed check. This is release tooling only; it does not change the shipped app or how released artifacts verify.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-06-16

- CI: enabled automatic release-asset signing in GitHub Actions by configuring the `AX_CODE_DESKTOP_MINISIGN_SECRET_KEY_B64` and `AX_CODE_DESKTOP_MINISIGN_PASSWORD` secrets and pinning the new desktop minisign public key in the verify workflows. Releases cut from this point forward are signed in CI directly, and the Homebrew cask is bumped automatically — no manual recovery signing or cask edit required.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-06-16

- Release: rotated the AX Code Desktop minisign release-signing key to a desktop-specific keypair (public key id `5B7AB63CD6D674BE`). The pinned public key in the signing script, verify workflows, README, and docs, plus the pinning tests, now reference the new key. Releases before this change were signed with the previous shared key (`8138FAD32CAD95BA`).

## [1.1.4] - 2026-06-16

- Security: hardened the desktop IPC origin guard, session IDs, and HTTP headers.
- Proxy: report `restarting` state when the AX Code upstream is unreachable so the UI surfaces the reconnect attempt instead of an opaque failure.
- UI: corrected a "below" typo in the multirun fork prompt template.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-06-14

- UI: fixed the first-run and cold-start provider load path so setup no longer dead-ends while provider configuration is still loading.
- CI: retried dependency installs to absorb transient GitHub tarball download failures during the main verification workflow.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-14

- Desktop: fixed Electron desktop update detection so the local desktop shell uses the native updater instead of the web update path.
- Desktop: normalized OS open-project paths before matching existing projects, preventing duplicate handling for equivalent dropped folder paths.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-14

- Desktop: added macOS and Windows OS shell handling so dropping a folder onto AX Code Desktop can add or activate that project.
- UI: fixed first-run provider loading and improved project knowledge detection for AGENTS.md files.
- Tests: kept the Electron open-path coverage compatible with the repository's Bun/Vitest test runner split.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-14

- Desktop: made the Electron shell the default desktop runtime and removed the legacy Tauri shell.
- Desktop: added VS Code-style zoom controls to the Electron View menu.
- UI: added the AutomatosX theme defaults and aligned add-provider and scrollbar highlights with the active theme color.
- Runtime: fixed desktop event delivery, SSH cleanup, and mini-chat hand-off reliability.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-12

- UI: added session activity badges, permission notifications, done-not-committed prompts, diff comment summaries, and loading/error polish for desktop workflows.
- Security: hardened AX Code integration startup/proxy handling and desktop-native path boundaries.
- Windows: corrected session sorting and async file reads in the desktop server proxy.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-11

- Desktop: hardened updater error handling, sidecar shutdown, resource path validation, and packaged search paths for the first stable AX Code Desktop release.
- Server: preserved leading slashes in file-search requests so desktop search endpoints resolve correctly in packaged builds.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-06-11

- Desktop: restored the leading slash in the packaged health-check URL so the desktop boot probe calls `/api/global/health` correctly.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-10

- Desktop: tightened the AX Code runtime boundary with shared endpoint contracts, SDK version gates, and runtime readiness forwarding.
- Server: tracked SDK handle exits and surfaced runtime readiness state through the desktop server health path.
- Performance: reduced desktop runtime overhead and moved integration paths toward the public AX Code UI/API surface.
- Internal: added boundary-hardening checks and planning docs for search index ownership and desktop runtime consolidation.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-06-08

- Config: reload providers, agents, commands, and skills in the background so settings changes no longer block the UI.
- Config: added shared background reload handling and route coverage for non-blocking AX Code config refreshes.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-08

- Desktop: isolated the managed AX Code runtime behind desktop-only bridge headers and hardened server access against browser-origin requests.
- Desktop: added startup diagnostics for packaged server failures, including manifest checks, executable checks, port checks, and log tailing.
- Release: added a packaged Electron smoke test gate so desktop release builds verify app startup before publishing.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-06-08

- UI: removed the remaining CSS mask rendering paths from scroll-shadow and reveal surfaces to avoid masked rendering artifacts.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-08

- Desktop: isolated the bundled web server into an Electron `utilityProcess` and moved renderer hot paths off unbounded synchronous work.
- Desktop: packaged the Electron server process explicitly and waits for graceful server shutdown before quit.
- Git/Remote SSH: hardened remote command probing by shell-quoting command names before execution.
- Sync/UI: kept sessions with pending questions visible while trimming event windows and bounded long-running in-memory Maps.
- CI: split Windows release builds by architecture to avoid cross-architecture native module reuse.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-08

- Security: removed browser/server voice, TTS, STT, and microphone permission surfaces from AX Code Desktop.
- Security: removed built-in Cloudflare/ngrok public tunnel provisioning and related CLI, settings, docs, and server routes.
- SDK: refreshed the vendored AX Code JavaScript SDK from `defai-digital/ax-code` and kept desktop integration on the current v2 app API.
- Desktop: completed the AX Code Desktop naming cleanup, English-only UI cleanup, and canonical AX Code package usage for remote SSH installs.
- Release: added Windows arm64 packaging support and per-architecture update manifest merging.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-07

- Release: moved minisign signing into the GitHub release workflow, pinned the release public key, and requires signature coverage before publishing release drafts.
- Desktop: refreshed the Windows icon asset used by Electron packaging.
- Docs: consolidated desktop documentation around the maintained web and Electron surfaces, including release, install, proxy, tunnel, and security guidance.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-06

- Release: added a guarded GitHub release publishing script with local validation, tag creation, workflow watching, and optional minisign signature upload.
- Release: documented minisign key generation, artifact signing, and the GitHub publishing workflow.
- Branding: refreshed web favicon and logo assets, including a 512px touch icon.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-06

- Git: surface fetch errors when resolving an existing remote branch instead of silently swallowing them.
- Settings: align settings copy with desktop support status.
- Cleanup: remove unused mobile context usage view, unused git sync translations, and redundant code paths.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-06

- Runtimes: removed the unsupported VS Code extension and mobile/PWA runtimes — the app now targets the desktop and web experiences only, dropping the associated dead code, layouts, and update branches.
- Git: clarified push behavior and removed the implicit auto-push of commits and branches.
- Docs: rewrote the README around desktop downloads and added direct release download links.
- Internal: centralized viewer-mode, browser-voice, and git-conflict preferences, moved legacy settings resources, and removed unused exports/parameters and stale comments.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-06-06

- Release: macOS desktop artifacts are now Apple Silicon only; release, smoke, Electron updater, and legacy Tauri updater manifest paths no longer build or require macOS x64 artifacts.
- Desktop/Windows: rebuilt the Windows app icon as a 256x256 ICO so electron-builder can produce the unsigned Windows installer and portable zip.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-06-06

- Branding: aligned the settings source namespace, notification fallbacks, issue template text, About dialog title, and theme metadata with AX Code Desktop while preserving legacy compatibility paths.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-06-06

- Release: fixed the desktop packaging pipeline — macOS and Windows builds now package correctly (electron-builder config and Windows binary resolution), and npm registry publishing is opt-in and non-fatal so it no longer blocks releases.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-06-06

- Release: the release workflow now skips signing, notarization, and npm publish gracefully when their secrets aren't configured, so a release still publishes unsigned desktop artifacts and the npm tarball instead of failing.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-05

- Chat: added an execution-mode selector (Manual / Autonomous / Supervised long-run) to the composer toolbar.
- Desktop: the in-app updater now uses AX Code's own release channel instead of surfacing inherited package metadata and release notes.
- Updates: the web/CLI update source is now configurable via env and no longer defaults to inherited upstream endpoints; with nothing configured it reports no update without phoning home.
- Desktop/Windows: added a portable zip build alongside the installer, and renamed the published npm tarball to ax-code-web.
- Chat: fixed a scroll-spy bookkeeping leak that retained detached nodes.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-05

- Desktop: renamed the packaged app to AX Code Desktop and removed the startup splash window.
- Desktop: fixed packaged startup failures caused by missing bundled server assets and JSONC parser internals.
- Chat: reduced send latency by lowering the upstream SSE reconnect delay.
- Sync: fixed relative changed-file path matching and an upstream SSE reader leak.

## Pre-Rebrand History

Earlier upstream history is intentionally omitted from this AX Code Desktop changelog. Current release notes should describe AX Code Desktop only; legacy implementation names belong in compatibility notes when they are required for paths, environment variables, or endpoint names.

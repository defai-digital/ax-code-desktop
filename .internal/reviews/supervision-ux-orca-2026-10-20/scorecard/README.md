# Competitor UX scorecard, round 2 (2026-10-20)

Persona: a developer supervising 5-20 parallel coding-agent sessions. Weights: overview 40%, review 35%, workspace 25%.
Evidence given to every judge: `competitor-facts.md` (docs/source facts, V = verified, I = inference), `matrix2.md` (capability
matrix with AX source citations, written by codex before the activity preview merged) and the native WebMCP journey script.
Unknown competitor capabilities do not count as competitor weaknesses.

| Judge | AX | Orca | Claude Code | Codex app | opencode | AX vs Orca | AX vs opencode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| codex | 7.40 | 8.80 | 8.43 | 7.95 | 6.58 | worse | better |
| deepseek-flash | 7.75 | 8.65 | 6.60 | 7.35 | 7.25 | worse | better |
| MiniMax-M3 | invalid | | | | | | |

MiniMax could not read the evidence files (scratch path denied) and scored competitors from memory; its result is kept only for
the record and not counted.

Result: AX Code Desktop is judged better than opencode desktop and still behind Orca for this persona. Gaps both valid judges
named: compound filters and child-agent rows on the overview, two sessions side by side / pane splitting in the workspace, and in
review a selectable base or branch scope, anchored and resolvable comments with a target picker, and viewed marks bound to the full
diff identity for git scopes. The activity preview was ungated (all densities, beside goal/error lines) after this round, as both
judges recommended. Round 3 targets the remaining feasible gaps and is re-judged.

# AX Code Desktop

AX Code Desktop is the desktop UI for [AX Code](https://github.com/defai-digital/ax-code). It gives AX Code users a full workspace interface for chat sessions, file review, diffs, Git operations, terminals, project notes, and multi-agent workflows.

## Install On macOS

The recommended way to install on macOS is via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask defai-digital/ax-code-desktop/ax-code-desktop
```

To update:

```bash
brew upgrade --cask ax-code-desktop
```

### Manual DMG (alternative)

If you prefer not to use Homebrew, download the latest DMG from the [Releases page](https://github.com/defai-digital/ax-code-desktop/releases):

1. Open the `.dmg` file.
2. Drag **AX Code Desktop** into **Applications**.
3. Launch **AX Code Desktop** from Applications.

If macOS says the app is damaged, run this in Terminal after installing:

```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/AX Code Desktop.app"
```

## Install On Windows

### Installer (recommended)

1. Download the latest `.exe` installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/defai-digital/ax-code-desktop/releases).
2. Run the installer.
3. Start **AX Code Desktop** from the Start Menu or Desktop shortcut.

### Portable ZIP

1. Download the latest Windows `.zip` from Releases.
2. Extract the entire ZIP folder.
3. Run `AX Code Desktop.exe` from the extracted folder.

Do not run the executable directly from inside the ZIP viewer — extract first so the app can find its bundled resources.

If Windows SmartScreen warns about an unknown publisher, click **More info → Run anyway** only if you downloaded from the official [Releases page](https://github.com/defai-digital/ax-code-desktop/releases).

## Before You Start

Install and sign in to the AX Code CLI first:

```bash
ax-code --version
```

If `ax-code` is not found, install AX Code before launching AX Code Desktop. The desktop app manages the local UI runtime but needs the AX Code CLI available for coding sessions.

## First Run

On first launch:

1. Confirm AX Code CLI is detected.
2. Add a project folder.
3. Start or select a chat session.
4. Use the Git, Files, Diff, Terminal, and Plan views as needed.

The app can run local AX Code sessions, connect to existing AX Code servers, and open focused mini-chat windows for active sessions.

## Updates

**macOS (Homebrew):**

```bash
brew upgrade --cask ax-code-desktop
```

**Windows / manual installs:** Download the latest installer or archive from the [Releases page](https://github.com/defai-digital/ax-code-desktop/releases). When auto-update metadata is available, the app can also check GitHub releases for updates automatically.

## What You Can Do

### Chat and Sessions

- Run AX Code chat sessions in a full workspace UI.
- Branch, fork, undo, and redo conversation turns.
- Queue messages and keep long-running sessions visible.
- Use plan/build workflows and project notes.
- Open mini-chat windows for focused work.

### Git and GitHub

- Stage files, commit, push, pull, merge, and rebase.
- Review diffs with inline or stacked views.
- Manage branches and worktrees.
- Create pull requests with generated descriptions.
- Recover from merge/rebase conflicts with guided UI state.

### Files and Terminal

- Browse and edit workspace files.
- Inspect large diffs without loading the whole workspace at once.
- Run integrated terminal sessions by project directory.
- Keep project actions and dev servers close to the chat context.

### Desktop

- Native desktop shell for macOS Apple Silicon and Windows x64.
- Multi-window workflows.
- Deep links and desktop menu actions.
- Local runtime management for the web UI.

## Security Notes

macOS users installing via Homebrew bypass Gatekeeper automatically — no extra steps needed.

For manual downloads, only use the official [Releases page](https://github.com/defai-digital/ax-code-desktop/releases). Release assets include detached `.minisig` signatures that can be verified with this pinned public key:

```

Windows SmartScreen may warn about unsigned builds; click **More info → Run anyway** if you trust the source.

AX Code Desktop is intended for trusted desktop workstations. Do not expose the development web UI publicly.

## Development Web UI

The web package is the local UI substrate used by development and desktop packaging. It is not a supported end-user distribution mode.

From a development checkout:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm --filter ./packages/web run start -- --ui-password your-password
```

The web UI is available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Development

Requirements:

- Node.js 24 (`>=24 <25`)
- pnpm 9.x (`corepack enable`)
- AX Code CLI

Useful commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run type-check
pnpm run lint
pnpm run test
pnpm run electron:dev
pnpm run electron:build
```

Package layout:

| Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/ui` | Shared React UI, stores, hooks, and components |
| `packages/web` | Local web runtime used by development and desktop packaging |
| `packages/electron` | Desktop shell (Electron) |

## Legacy Compatibility Notes

AX Code Desktop is the user-facing product name. Some internal package names,
storage keys, environment variables, endpoint paths, and config directories
still use `openchamber` so existing installs and migrated data continue to work.

Treat those names as legacy compatibility details, not as the public product
identity for new docs, releases, or UI copy.

# Contributing to AX Code Desktop

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/defai-digital/ax-code-desktop.git
cd ax-code-desktop
bun install
```

This repository pins `bun@1.3.14` in `package.json`; use that version for
local installs so dependency resolution matches CI.

On Apple Silicon with newer Node versions, the optional `sharp` dependency can
fall back to a source build and require libvips. If `bun install` fails while
linking `vips-cpp`, install the system library and retry:

```bash
brew install vips
bun install
```

## Dev Scripts

### Web

| Script | Description | Ports |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `bun run dev:web:full` | Build watcher + Express server. No HMR — manual refresh after changes. | `3001` (server + static) |
| `bun run dev:web:hmr` | Vite dev server + Express API. **Open the Vite URL for HMR**, not the backend. | `5180` (Vite HMR), `3902` (API) |

Both are configurable via env vars: `AX_CODE_DESKTOP_PORT`, `AX_CODE_DESKTOP_HMR_UI_PORT`, `AX_CODE_DESKTOP_HMR_API_PORT`.

### Desktop (Tauri)

```bash
bun run desktop:dev
```

Launches Tauri in dev mode with WebView devtools enabled and a distinct dev icon.

### Shared UI (`packages/ui`)

No dev server — this is a source-level library consumed by other packages. During development, `bun run dev` runs type-checking in watch mode.

## Before Submitting

```bash
bun run type-check   # Must pass
bun run lint         # Must pass
bun run build        # Must succeed
```

## Code Style

- Functional React components only
- TypeScript strict mode — no `any` without justification
- Use existing theme colors/typography from `packages/ui/src/lib/theme/` — don't add new ones
- Components must support light and dark themes
- Prefer early returns and `if/else`/`switch` over nested ternaries
- Tailwind v4 for styling; typography via `packages/ui/src/lib/typography.ts`

## Branding and Attribution

- Use AX Code Desktop for public product names, release text, screenshots, and user-facing UI.
- Keep `openchamber` names only where they are required for compatibility with existing data, APIs, package internals, or migration paths.
- Do not remove upstream OpenChamber attribution from [NOTICE](./NOTICE). If a change imports or replaces code from another project, update `NOTICE` in the same pull request.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork and create a branch

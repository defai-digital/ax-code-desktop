# GitHub release publishing

Use the guarded publish script from the repository root:

```bash
bun run publish:github -- --version 0.8.0
```

Before running it, bump the package versions, add the matching
`CHANGELOG.md` section, and commit those changes. The script intentionally does
not edit source files during publishing; it validates that the prepared release
commit is safe to tag.

That first run is a dry-run preflight. It validates package versions,
`CHANGELOG.md`, Git state, GitHub authentication, docs, tests, type-checking,
linting, and build output. It does not create a tag or mutate GitHub.

When the dry run passes, publish:

```bash
bun run publish:github -- --version 0.8.0 --publish
```

The publish path:

1. Verifies the worktree is clean and `HEAD` matches the release branch on
   `origin`.
2. Verifies the local and remote `v<version>` tag do not already exist.
3. Verifies the GitHub Release does not already exist.
4. Runs `bun run docs:validate`, `bun run test`, `bun run type-check`,
   `bun run lint`, and `bun run build`.
5. Creates and pushes the annotated `v<version>` tag.
6. Waits for `.github/workflows/release.yml` to finish.
7. The workflow signs each release asset with `scripts/minisign-artifacts.sh`
   using the `AX_CODE_DESKTOP_MINISIGN_SECRET_KEY_B64` and
   `AX_CODE_DESKTOP_MINISIGN_PASSWORD` GitHub Actions secrets.
8. The workflow uploads the generated `.minisig` files before publishing the
   draft release.
9. Verifies the release is public and every signed asset has a matching
    `.minisig`.

If the GitHub workflow succeeded before signatures were uploaded, or you need
to repair signature assets manually, rerun only the local signature upload step:

```bash
bun run publish:github -- --version 0.8.0 --signatures-only --publish
```

On macOS, the local repair path can read the minisign passphrase from Apple
Keychain when `AX_CODE_DESKTOP_MINISIGN_PASSWORD` is not set. See
`docs/MINISIGN.md` for the Keychain item names.

Use `--skip-signing` only for emergency releases where detached minisign
signatures are intentionally not being published. Use `--skip-local-validation`
only after the same validation commands have already passed on the exact commit
being tagged.

# Project Boundaries

This repository works best when the desktop app stays a thin integration layer
around the AX Code runtime instead of becoming a second runtime implementation.
Use this map when adding features, moving code, or deciding where a bug should
be fixed.

## Ownership map

| Area | Owns | Should not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/electron` | Window lifecycle, auto-update, packaged resources, utility-process startup, desktop security policy | AX Code runtime behavior, provider logic, search logic, project indexing |
| `packages/web/server` | Local desktop control plane: loopback HTTP server, auth bridge, static app hosting, local file/git/terminal adapters, AX Code process lifecycle | UI presentation, SDK-private internals, duplicated AX Code runtime semantics |
| `packages/web/src` | Browser entrypoints and web runtime adapters that install `RuntimeAPIs` for the UI | Deep UI internals, desktop shell behavior |
| `packages/ui` | Presentation, state, typed UI API contracts, SDK-facing client facade | Local process lifecycle, Electron APIs, Tauri APIs, server-only dependencies |
| `vendor/ax-code-sdk` / installed `ax-code` | Sessions, models/providers, skills/plugins, search/indexing, runtime API contracts | Desktop windowing or packaging |

## Import rules

- `packages/web` may import `@openchamber/ui` only through documented UI
  entrypoints: app entrypoints, styles, `terminalApi`, and `api/*` contracts.
- `packages/web` and `packages/electron` must not import sibling package source
  paths such as `../ui/src` or `../desktop/src`.
- Runtime access should prefer public SDK entrypoints such as `@ax-code/sdk/v2`
  and the server-side AX Code lifecycle adapter. Do not import SDK `dist/`
  internals.

The enforced subset of these rules lives in `scripts/check-boundary-imports.mjs`.
When a new cross-package entrypoint is genuinely needed, add it to the checker
with a short reason in the change description.

## Stability guidance

- Keep Electron work focused on startup, packaging, update, window, and security
  concerns. Server CPU and IO should stay out of the main process.
- Keep AX Code feature behavior behind SDK/API contracts. If desktop code needs
  to mirror SDK internals, track it as temporary compatibility debt.
- Prefer explicit degraded states over silent mock data or empty fallbacks for
  backend failures.
- Add verification before moving ownership. A refactor that only moves code but
  weakens tests or runtime contracts is not a boundary improvement.

## Performance guidance

- Preserve the utility-process server boundary; it protects the main Electron
  event loop from server work.
- Treat bundle size as a UI loading concern first. Lazy-load heavy UI surfaces
  before moving runtime ownership across packages.
- Measure `ax-code` pipeline overhead before changing transport layers. The
  current SDK headless bridge is the supported integration path until upstream
  ships a materially different runtime transport.
